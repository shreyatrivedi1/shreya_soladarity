1. Your contract will contain public variables that record the specifics of your coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply). My project {

// Public variables to hold information about the coin
string public firm_name = "MyToken"; string public short_form = "MTK";
uint256 public netProfit;

2. Your contract will include a mapping from addresses to balances (address => uint).

// Mapping of addresses to balances mapping(address => uint256) Public balances:

3. You will have a mint function with two parameters: an address and a value. The function then increases the overall supply by that number and the address's balance by that amount.

 To produce new tokens, use the mint function: function mint(address to, uint256 value) public { netProfit += value;Â 
balances[to] += value;

4.  Your contract will have a burn function, which, unlike the mint function, destroys tokens. It will accept an address and a value, same like the mint functions. It will then deduct the amount from the total supply and the balance of the address. To destroy tokens, use the burn function. function burn (address from, uint256 value) public

5. Finally, your burn function should include conditionals to ensure that the balance of account is more than or equal to the amount intended to be burned.

{ require(balances[from] >= value, "Insufficient balance to burn"); // Ensure the sender has adequate balance netProfit -= value; // Decrease the overall supply by the burnt amount balances[from] -= value; // Decrease the sender's balance } `
