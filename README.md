1. Your contract will contain public variables that store the specifics of your coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply). My project {

// Public variables to store information about the coin
String public firm_name = "token name"; string public short_form = "Short token"; uint256 public netProfit; 2 Your contract will include a mapping from addresses to balances (address => uint).

// Mapping of addresses to balances mapping(address => uint256) Public balances: 3 You will have a mint function with two parameters: an address and a value. The function then increases the total supply by that number and the address's balance by that amount.

 To create new tokens, use the mint function with the address to and uint256 value.
 = value; // Increase the recipient's balance.
4 Your contract will have a burn function, which, unlike the mint function, destroys tokens. It will accept an address and a value, same like the mint functions. The value will then be deducted from both the overall supply and the address's balance. // Use the Burn function to destroy tokens. function Burn(address from, uint256 value) public

5 Finally, your burn function should include conditionals to ensure that the balance of account is more than or equal to the amount intended to be burned.

{ require(balances[from] >= value, "Insufficient balance to burn"); // Ensure the sender has adequate balance netProfit -= value; // Reduce the overall supply by the burned amount balances[from] -= value; // Decrease the balance
